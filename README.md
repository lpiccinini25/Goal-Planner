# Task Managing
A task managing website using React + vite for frontend and the django REST API framework for backend. User authentication is handled via javascript tokens, and api is interacted via django class based views. 
Users can plan their schedule using the calendar, recurring events, and can assign priority to tasks on a scale of 1-4 points. The total amount of points earned each week is calculated, and compared against other 
weeks to track improvement in productivity. 

# Features
• Used Django’s REST framework and class-based views to seamlessly interact with SQLite-backed database.
• Implemented token-based authentication in JavaScript to support user-created accounts.
• Developed a points-based incentive system to encourage users to complete tasks.
